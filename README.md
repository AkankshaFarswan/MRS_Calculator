# MRS Staging Calculator
A modified staging system for Multiple Myeloma.

MRS is based on easy to acquire laboratory and clinical parameters, Age, albumin, B2M, Calcium, eGFR and Hemoglobin.

Download the html link and run it. Enter the parameters and it will assign a risk stage to the patient depending upon his parameters and also provide his OS and PFS.
OS and PFS were calculated from data of nearly 2000 MM patients (900 from MMRF and 1070 from MMIn dataset) for each risk group defined by MRS.
